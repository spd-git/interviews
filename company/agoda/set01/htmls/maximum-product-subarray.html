Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return _the product_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Note** that the product of an array with a single element is the value of that element.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,-2,4]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** [2,3] has the largest product 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-2,0,-1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
*   `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
*   The product of any subarray of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
