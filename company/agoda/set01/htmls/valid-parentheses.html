Hint

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1.   Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.   Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3.   Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**s = "()"

**Output:**true

**Example 2:**

**Input:**s = "()[]{}"

**Output:**true

**Example 3:**

**Input:**s = "(]"

**Output:**false

**Example 4:**

**Input:**s = "([])"

**Output:**true

**Example 5:**

**Input:**s = "([)]"

**Output:**false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
*   `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.
