Hint

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_`kth`_smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**

![Image 9](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree1.jpg)**Input:** root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

![Image 10](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg)**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
