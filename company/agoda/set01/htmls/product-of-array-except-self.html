Hint

Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array_`answer`_such that_`answer[i]`_is equal to the product of all the elements of_`nums`_except_`nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in`O(n)`time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [24,12,8,6]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
**Output:** [0,0,9,0,0]

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
*   The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Follow up:**Can you solve the problem in `O(1)`extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

Hint 1

Think how you can efficiently utilize prefix and suffix products to calculate the product of all elements except self for each index. Can you pre-compute the prefix and suffix products in linear time to avoid redundant calculations?

* * *

Hint 2

Can you minimize additional space usage by reusing memory or modifying the input array to store intermediate results?
