Hint

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

![Image 8](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = [1,1]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `n == height.length`
*   `2 <= n <= 105`
*   `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

Hint 1

If you simulate the problem, it will be O(n^2) which is not efficient.

* * *

Hint 2

Try to use two-pointers. Set one pointer to the left and one to the right of the array. Always move the pointer that points to the lower line.

* * *

Hint 3

How can you calculate the amount of water at each step?
