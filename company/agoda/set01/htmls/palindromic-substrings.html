Hint

Given a string `s`, return _the number of **palindromic substrings** in it_.

A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaa"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

Hint 1

How can we reuse a previously computed palindrome to compute a larger palindrome?

* * *

Hint 2

If “aba” is a palindrome, is “xabax” a palindrome? Similarly is “xabay” a palindrome?

* * *

Hint 3

Complexity based hint:

 If we use brute force and check whether for every start and end position a substring is a palindrome we have O(n^2) start - end pairs and O(n) palindromic checks. Can we reduce the time for palindromic checks to O(1) by reusing some previous computation?
