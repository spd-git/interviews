Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in`O(n)`time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
**Output:** 9

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,0,1,2]
**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
