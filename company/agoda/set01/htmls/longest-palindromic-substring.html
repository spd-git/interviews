Hint

Given a string `s`, return _the longest_ in `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "babad"
**Output:** "bab"
**Explanation:** "aba" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cbbd"
**Output:** "bb"

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
*   `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

Hint 1

How can we reuse a previously computed palindrome to compute a larger palindrome?

* * *

Hint 2

If “aba” is a palindrome, is “xabax” a palindrome? Similarly is “xabay” a palindrome?

* * *

Hint 3

Complexity based hint:

 If we use brute-force and check whether for every start and end position a substring is a palindrome we have O(n^2) start - end pairs and O(n) palindromic checks. Can we reduce the time for palindromic checks to O(1) by reusing some previous computation.
