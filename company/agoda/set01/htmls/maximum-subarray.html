Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return _its sum_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

**Follow up:** If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the **divide and conquer** approach, which is more subtle.
