Given an array of `intervals`where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
**Output:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
**Explanation:** Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
**Output:** [[1,5]]
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
**Output:** [[1,7]]
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
*   `intervals[i].length == 2`
*   `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`
