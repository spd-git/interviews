There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly left rotated** at an unknown index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be left rotated by`3`indices and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums`**after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_`target`_if it is in_`nums`_, or_`-1`_if it is not in_`nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1], target = 0
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   All values of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
*   `-104 <= target <= 104`
