Hint

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of`subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Example 1:**

![Image 9](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree1-tree.jpg)**Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![Image 10](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/28/subtree2-tree.jpg)**Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
*   The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `-104 <= root.val <= 104`
*   `-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104`

Hint 1

Which approach is better here- recursive or iterative?

* * *

Hint 2

If recursive approach is better, can you write recursive function with its parameters?

* * *

Hint 3

Two trees **s** and **t** are said to be identical if their root values are same and their left and right subtrees are identical. Can you write this in form of recursive formulae?

* * *

Hint 4

Recursive formulae can be: isIdentical(s,t)= s.val==t.val AND isIdentical(s.left,t.left) AND isIdentical(s.right,t.right)
