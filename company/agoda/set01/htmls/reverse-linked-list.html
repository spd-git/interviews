Easy

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example 1:**

![Image 9](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [5,4,3,2,1]

**Example 2:**

![Image 10](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)**Input:** head = [1,2]
**Output:** [2,1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = []
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
*   `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

**Follow up:** A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
