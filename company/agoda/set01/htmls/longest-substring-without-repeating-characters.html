Hint

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest****substring** without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcabcbb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that `"bca"` and `"cab"` are also correct answers.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "bbbbb"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "pwwkew"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
*   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
