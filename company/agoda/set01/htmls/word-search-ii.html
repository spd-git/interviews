Hint

Given an `m x n``board`of characters and a list of strings `words`, return _all words on the board_.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example 1:**

![Image 9](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search1.jpg)**Input:** board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
**Output:** ["eat","oath"]

**Example 2:**

![Image 10](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search2.jpg)**Input:** board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 12`
*   `board[i][j]` is a lowercase English letter.
*   `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `words` are unique.

Hint 1

You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?

* * *

Hint 2

If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. What kind of data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, please work on this problem: [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/) first.
