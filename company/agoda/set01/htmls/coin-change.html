You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
*   `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `0 <= amount <= 104`
