Hint

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
**Output:** [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
**Explanation:** 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,1]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [0,0,0]
**Output:** [[0,0,0]]
**Explanation:** The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `3 <= nums.length <= 3000`
*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`

Hint 1

So, we essentially need to find three numbers x, y, and z such that they add up to the given value. If we fix one of the numbers say x, we are left with the two-sum problem at hand!

* * *

Hint 2

For the two-sum problem, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y, which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster?

* * *

Hint 3

The second train of thought for two-sum is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?
