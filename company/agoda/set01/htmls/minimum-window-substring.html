Hint

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_**_substring_**_of_`s`_such that every character in_`t`_(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_`""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
**Output:** "BANC"
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "a"
**Output:** "a"
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "aa"
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

**Constraints:**

*   `m == s.length`
*   `n == t.length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 105`
*   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

Hint 1

Use two pointers to create a window of letters in s, which would have all the characters from t.

* * *

Hint 2

Expand the right pointer until all the characters of t are covered.

* * *

Hint 3

Once all the characters are covered, move the left pointer and ensure that all the characters are still covered to minimize the subarray size.

* * *

Hint 4

Continue expanding the right and left pointers until you reach the end of s.
