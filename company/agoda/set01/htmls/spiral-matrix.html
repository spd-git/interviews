Hint

Given an `m x n``matrix`, return _all elements of the_`matrix`_in spiral order_.

**Example 1:**

![Image 9](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/spiral1.jpg)**Input:** matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
**Output:** [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

**Example 2:**

![Image 10](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/spiral.jpg)**Input:** matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
**Output:** [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

**Constraints:**

*   `m == matrix.length`
*   `n == matrix[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 10`
*   `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

Hint 1

Well for some problems, the best way really is to come up with some algorithms for simulation. Basically, you need to simulate what the problem asks us to do.

* * *

Hint 2

We go boundary by boundary and move inwards. That is the essential operation. First row, last column, last row, first column, and then we move inwards by 1 and repeat. That's all. That is all the simulation that we need.

* * *

Hint 3

Think about when you want to switch the progress on one of the indexes. If you progress on i out of [i, j], you'll shift in the same column. Similarly, by changing values for j, you'd be shifting in the same row. Also, keep track of the end of a boundary so that you can move inwards and then keep repeating. It's always best to simulate edge cases like a single column or a single row to see if anything breaks or not.
