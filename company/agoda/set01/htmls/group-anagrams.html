Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

**Output:**[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Explanation:**

*   There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
*   The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
*   The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**strs = [""]

**Output:**[[""]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:**strs = ["a"]

**Output:**[["a"]]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
*   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
*   `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
