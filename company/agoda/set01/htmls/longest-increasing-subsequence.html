Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **strictly increasing**_ _**subsequence**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

**Follow up:**Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in`O(n log(n))` time complexity?
