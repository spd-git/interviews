Hint

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**._ If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
*   `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

Hint 1

Try dynamic programming. DP[i][j] represents the longest common subsequence of text1[0 ... i] & text2[0 ... j].

* * *

Hint 2

DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 , if text1[i] == text2[j] DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1]) , otherwise
