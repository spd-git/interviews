You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

**Example 1:**

![Image 8](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)**Input:** list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
**Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** list1 = [], list2 = []
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

**Input:** list1 = [], list2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
*   Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
