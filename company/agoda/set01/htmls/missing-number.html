Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Example 1:**

**Input:**nums = [3,0,1]

**Output:**2

**Explanation:**

`n = 3` since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,3]`. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**nums = [0,1]

**Output:**2

**Explanation:**

`n = 2` since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,2]`. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:**nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

**Output:**8

**Explanation:**

`n = 9` since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,9]`. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 104`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?
