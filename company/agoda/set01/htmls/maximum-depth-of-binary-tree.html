Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth**is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

![Image 8](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)**Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,2]
**Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
