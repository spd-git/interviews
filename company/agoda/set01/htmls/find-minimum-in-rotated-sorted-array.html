Hint

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
*   `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

You must write an algorithm that runs in`O(log n) time`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [11,13,15,17]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
*   All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

Hint 1

Array was originally in ascending order. Now that the array is rotated, there would be a point in the array where there is a small deflection from the increasing sequence. eg. The array would be something like [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2].

* * *

Hint 2

You can divide the search space into two and see which direction to go. Can you think of an algorithm which has O(logN) search complexity?

* * *

Hint 3

1.   All the elements to the left of inflection point > first element of the array.
2.   All the elements to the right of inflection point < first element of the array.
