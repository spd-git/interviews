Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_`k`_most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

**Output:**[1,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:**nums = [1], k = 1

**Output:**[1]

**Example 3:**

**Input:**nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,3,2], k = 2

**Output:**[1,2]

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
*   `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
*   It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

**Follow up:** Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.
