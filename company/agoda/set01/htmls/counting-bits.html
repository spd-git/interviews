Hint

Given an integer `n`, return _an array_`ans`_of length_`n + 1`_such that for each_`i`(`0 <= i <= n`)_,_`ans[i]`_is the **number of**_`1`_**'s** in the binary representation of_`i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** [0,1,1]
**Explanation:**
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** [0,1,1,2,1,2]
**Explanation:**
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= n <= 105`

**Follow up:**

*   It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
*   Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?

Hint 1

You should make use of what you have produced already.

* * *

Hint 2

Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.

* * *

Hint 3

Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?
