Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 300`
*   `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
*   `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
*   `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `wordDict` are **unique**.
