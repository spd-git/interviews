Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

**Input:**n = 11

**Output:**3

**Explanation:**

The input binary string **1011** has a total of three set bits.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**n = 128

**Output:**1

**Explanation:**

The input binary string **10000000** has a total of one set bit.

**Example 3:**

**Input:**n = 2147483645

**Output:**30

**Explanation:**

The input binary string **1111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty set bits.

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
