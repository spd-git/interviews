Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys**strictly less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **strictly greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

![Image 9](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg)**Input:** root = [2,1,3]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![Image 10](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)**Input:** root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
*   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
